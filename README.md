stats for caps

A http-based API for storing/getting history from [caps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_(drinking_game)) games. That is, it's a http server that takes POST/GET/PUT/etc. commands to store and retrieve data. I'd call it RESTful, but I don't think it truly is. Maybe someday!

TODO: Describe http API here.
